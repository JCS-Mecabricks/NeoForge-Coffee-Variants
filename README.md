This mod adds coffee and its types to Minecraft

## Coffee Variants

**There are 5 types of coffees: mocha, latte, espresso, cappuccino, and regular coffee.
There is also a food called Affogato and a block called Coffee Station.**

Affogato is not craftable, it is only obtainable by a barista villager

The barista villager is made from the coffee station and will trade for any coffe I mentioned and their ingredients.
